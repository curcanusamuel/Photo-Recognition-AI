Anaconda + Jupyter Setup

    1. Download and install Anaconda https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/
    2. Optional - Create a requirements file to have the standard setup. Copy the lines below in a text file and name it requirements.txt. These libraries will install automatically when creating the environment.

jupyterlab
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
pandas

    3. Open an Anaconda Prompt and create a new environment. Cd to the folder containing the requirements file and run the following command: conda create --name env_si [--file  requirements.txt ].

    4. Activate environment: conda activate env_si. When an environment is activated, you will see its name on the left. To deactivate, you can run conda deactivate (don’t do that now)

    5. When you need to install addititional packages  in the environment
       conda install scikit-learn 
       or 
       pip install scikit-learn

    6. Open the Jupyter notebook (it’s recommended to cd into the directory where you saved your ipynb file so that you don’t have to look for it) by running the command: jupyter-lab
       
WHEN you need to remove an environment, you can use 
       conda remove --name env_si --all
